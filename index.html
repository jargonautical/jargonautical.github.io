  <h2>Making sense of data</h2>
	<div class="flex-container">
		<div style="clear: left;">
			<p>
				How do we make sense of data, and why does it merit a whole article? It can't be that complicated.
				Surely that's what graphs and stuff are for ... just shove your data into
				some kind of chart and the job is done, right?
        <br><br>
				Well, not really.
        <br><br>
        It's become easier and easier over the last few years to create charts
        and graphs. Lots more tools are available, many of them very
        intuitive to use even for a non-expert, and more often than not the
        design options they offer are so well-curated that even a complete beginner
        can produce a beautiful and clear chart in just a few steps.
        <br><br>
        And this is a problem, because data visualisation is about so much more than visualising data.
        It's sifting the data for meaning. It's cleaning, filtering and merging.
				It's crafting a message. It's a set of design choices around brand and audience.
				And most of all it's a response.
				<br><br>
				A response to what? Well, it's kind of your job to figure that out.
        If you're making something to visualise data in some way here's what you need to be asking yourself.
			</p>
			<ul>
        <li>What problem does this solve?</li>
				<li>What question could this answer?</li>
        <li>If I had an answer, what would it look like?</li>
        <li>Who will be looking at it? Why?</li>
      </ul>
			<p>To explore these questions, let's dive into an example.</p>
			<h3>What problem am I solving?</h3>
			<p>
				I spend several hours a week playing Destiny 2, an online multiplayer first-person shooter.
				Like many games in this genre it has a player-versus-player (PvP) mode where you can
				test your skills against other players in a controlled arena separate from the main
				story missions. Emotions run hot in this type of gameplay, and accusations of cheating are commonplace.
				<br><br>
				Being a middle-aged gamer with below-average
        reflexes I often come off worse in these competitions, and
				of course that's very frustrating. Occasionally I get matched
        against people so skilled, so godly, that
				I never stood a chance of beating them.
				<br><br>
				When that happens I can find myself hovering over the 'Report' button and
				asking myself this crucial question:
        <p class="query">"Do I really believe they were cheating - or am I just upset because I lost?"<p>
				I could really use a simple visual look up that tells me at a glance whether
				I'm justified in reporting a player, or whether I just need to get over it.
			  <br><br>
				One thing that sets Destiny as a game apart from many others is its very rich, well-structured and
				well-documented API - hence the varied ecosystem of supporting apps and services.
				With a developer account I can access game data for myself and other
				players, and using that I can do pretty much any analysis that takes my fancy.
				<br><br>
				I started with an assumption: it should be possible to get some data to analyse who the likely cheats are in
				the games I'd played recently. That sort of thing would show up in their game statistics, wouldn't it? Simple.
				All I needed to do is extract all of the game stats and then try out different analyses
				until I get an answer.
			</p>
			<p style="float: right;"><img src="./assets/kmeans.png" width="300" border="1px"></p>
			<p>
				And this is exactly what I did, using the API to extract a massive file for a sample of players.
				I included myself as a control (since I know I'm not cheating!). For the same reason I included a couple of friends
				who I know absolutely would never do so, and for good measure I got data on a small number of professional streamers
				with excellent reputations for fair play. For balance I then included at least one known cheater (recently and
				very publicly banned) and a few people I've played with and against in the past and had doubts about.
				<br><br>
				Armed with this data, I built several different models and reviewed the results. I won't bore the reader
				with the details of each one because, as it turned out, none of them could identify any meaningful pattern.
				<br><br>
				The k-means model shown on the right looked very promising, but when I delved into it further with a principal
				components analysis it indicated that match duration and total team score (the number of kills by
				everyone in the player's team combined) were most significant
				factors in whether that person was likely to be cheating. That clearly can't be right in this context.
			</p>
			<h4>So what could the data tell me?</h4>


      <p>
				Well, skilled players tend to be good across both competitive and casual game modes, and they play more matches overall
				(getting in a lot of practice).
				Obviously they win more, with a higher kills-to-deaths ratio (K/D), and more kills per game. They also do better
				on the percentage of precision shots with difficult-to-master weapons like sniper rifles.
				<br><br>
				Lots of these are also what you'd expect to see if someone were cheating ... so what's the crucial
				indicator for high-skill versus illegal mods?
				<br><br>
				I honestly couldn't tell you. My models either made no sense at all, or were impossibly 100% efficient.
				Sometimes both at once!
				And the more different models I built and the more I tweaked the parameters, the more I lost sight
				of the problem I was originally trying to solve.
			</p>
			<h4>Time for a sense check</h4>
			<p>
				Thinking about all the factors I'd added to the model, it became obvious that firstly
        there were too many, and secondly many of them were redundant.
      </p>
      <p style="float: right;"><img src="./assets/corr_trimmed.png" alt="A correlation matrix showing strong correlation between factors." width="400" padding="10px" border="1px"></p>
      <p>
				A good example of this is the range of stats about the number of kills.
				Average-score-per-life (avscpl) reflects how many kills a player can get before
				they're brought down by an opponent.
				This will be reflected in the kills-to-deaths ratio and also efficiency.
				Number of kills overall is strongly correlated to score, and so on. This is very
        clear when we look at the correlation matrix on the right, with all the darker-shaded areas
        around these particular factors.
				<br><br>
				Another factor which could be skewing the analysis is the player's choice of class. Options are:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Titan - strong and resilient. Basically a tank with fists.</li>
				<li>Warlock - healing and support. Flying, hovering, and looking fabulous.</li>
				<li>Hunter - mobile and sneaky. Jumping, dodging, can go invisible.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
			  There's a perception that frequent PvP players are more likely to play hunter,
				an archetype known for agility and stealth,
				and indeed several of my sample group play ONLY on hunter and have no characters in either of the other classes.
				This may or may not be meaningful, but it's certainly a balance issue for my dataset. I could remove it from the
				analysis, but that would just be more tinkering around the edges without a clear goal.
        It's time to go back to the beginning and remind myself what problem I'm trying to solve.
			</p>
      <h3>What question does this thing answer?</h3>
      <p>Thinking back to my original scenario, my issue here is not that I want to build a fully
        functional cheat detector. What I need is a way to see whether someone's performance against me
        seems feasible given their game history. The real question is this:
      </p>
			<p class="query">
				"Should I have expected this player to beat me?"
			</p>
			<p>
				I don't need machine learning models to answer that. I can look at the other player's character, build
				and gear choices, and use my own knowledge of the game's context to make a judgement.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Are they using the strongest weapon types?</li>
				<li>Are they are using known exploits?</li>
				<li>Are they using particlar exotic weapons or armour that add extra abilities?</li>
				<li>Are they at a significantly higher level than me?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				And of course I need to take a good hard look at myself too.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Are we playing on a PvP map that I'm not very familiar with?</li>
				<li>Am I using the right set up and play style for that map?</li>
				<li>Did I equip weapons or abilities that I haven't had enough practice with?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				When you're taking heavy and sustained fire from Mad Skillz McAimbot
				it's clearly not the time to pause for introspection, but it's a good habit
				to develop post-match. It's entirely possible that nobody here is cheating, and I simply need to 'git gud'.
			</p>
      <h3>If I had an answer, what would it look like?</h3>
			<p style="float: right;"><img src="./assets/best.png" width="400" border="1px"></p>
			<p>
				We're getting closer to a solution. With the data I've extracted I can review a player's gear, build and
				level. I can also look into their game history to see whether their win status or their kill count seems feasible.
				<br><br>
				Existing tracker apps can also do this, but they usually centre around a player's
				<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system>Elo rating</a>.
				For me this feels unhelpful in this context, because it only counts wins and losses.
				Win a game and you move up, lose a game and you move down.
				In a multiplayer activity where there can be (depending on match settings) up to six players per team, it's
				not an accurate measure of each player's performance.
				Someone with a high Elo could simply have been teamed up with very high-skill players - a 'carry',
				where the less-skilled player gets an easy ride with their team mates doing all the hard work.  By the same token
				someone with a streak of losses may actually be very good, but has been repeatedly matched with lower-ranked teammates in
				an effort to balance the lobby. Elo ratings work best in one-on-one scenarios.
				<br><br>
				In the API documentation I found that players are assigned a 'combat rating' which takes into account
				each person's individual performance and their contribution to the match result. This makes more sense to me,
				so I'll use that along with detailed data on things like the percentage of precision shots, and the usage of
				particular weapon archetypes and character builds which suggest careful tuning of attributes.
				<br><br>
				The scatter plot shows what some of that data looks like when plotted against kill
				count and all-time per-game average. This is starting to resemble something that
				could help with my particular question.
			</p>
			<p style="float: right;"><img src="./assets/app_card.png" width="400" border="1px"></p>
			<p>
				Here's where I abandoned complex models and started back at the beginning,
        writing a new script to pull out only the results of my latest match.
				Each time I play, if I have doubts, I can refresh this page and take a quick look at each player to see
				if I can spot any unusual patterns.
				<br><br>
				It's definitely progress, but there are still some issues. For one - it's ugly!
				<br><br>
				I built this based on something far more beautiful,
				<a href=https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-connect-to-an-api-with-javascript/>this tutorial on connecting to an API with javascript</a>,
				and then I played around with the colour gradients to indicate win/loss status (the colour at the top of the card) and the
				comparative combat rating (the stripe in the centre). I don't like how it looks right now, but colours are easy to tweak later.
				<br><br>
        What's more critical is deciding how to arrange this data. Is the colour coding informative or
				just distracting? Does the text adequately explain what these things mean?
				Are the items in a logical or intuitive order for the reader? What's the
				first thing I want to know when I look at this, and which items do I want to stand out?
				<br><br>
				The priority here is the comparison; I want this to be obvious at a glance. Is this person
				doing much, much better than they normally would? So we have three things to convey.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>direction of travel (better/worse)</li>
				<li>the extent of the difference (big/small), and </li>
				<li>a value judgement (good/bad).</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="flex-container">
		<div class="invisbox-small">
			<p>
				We could use a single symbol for all three dimensions. An up-arrow or down-arrow works to convey direction,
				optional colour to represent good/bad, and the arrow height can be made
				relative to the difference between this match and the usual average.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="invisbox-small">
			<p>
				Or we could use text formatting. Either the colour of the text itself or its background element could represent
				good/bad, and the font size could be relative to the difference between this match and the player's usual
				per-game average.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="invisbox-small">
			<p>
				Finally we could have a small plot showing the difference, maybe even leave out the colours
				and let the x-axis position or
				the labelling indicate which is this match and which is the usual average.
			</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="flex-container">
		<div class="invisbox-wide">
			<img src="./assets/mockup.jpeg" width="100%" align='center'>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="flex-container">
		<div style="clear: left;">
			<p>
				Even these very rough sketches were a huge help in choosing between the different options.
				Once I'd drawn them out I instantly preferred the bar chart idea.
				The text formatting could also work, and that would be my second
        choice if the bar charts turned out to be too awkward to code.
				<br><br>
				The arrow symbols weren't even in the running, as I realised when I tried to work out how
				to sketch it for the mockup. It felt unintuitive to have an arrow for the
				per-game average, since it's actually supposed to show the baseline, but then that meant I would have two different
				symbols side by side in that element. I didn't want to spend ages dithering over which symbols to choose here so
				that option was parked until I figure out a way to do it (or, more likely, get inspired by someone else's solution).
        <br><br>
        <h4>Here's the current interation.</h4>
        <p style="float: left;"><img src="./assets/app_card_final.png" width="400" border="1px"></p>
        <br>
        There's still some work to do on details like text padding, constraints for the chart, divider elements
				and labels. Overall though this is something that works for me. I've selected efficiency (the overall ratio of
				kills to deaths) as the one statistic I want to see in a chart, and the other values are a basic list for now.
        <br><br>
				Purely for fun, and because no Destiny 2 PvP match is complete without
				<a href=https://www.destinypedia.com/Shaxx>Lord Shaxx</a> yelling encouragement
				from the sidelines, I've included a carefully-selected voice line at the bottom of the card - each player
				gets a different motivational comment relating to their performance.
        <h3>So, what have we discovered?</h3>
        <h4>1. Data visualisation is communication </h4>
        <p>
          There's more to it than simply showing the data. It's a message with
          meaning, and you need to understand what the
          message is if you want to show it to people.
        </p>
        <h4>2. Solve the right problem</h4>
        <p>
          What you assume the issue is may turn out to be completely wrong once
          you start investigating the data - even if (as in my case here) you
          are the target audience for your own work. Make sure you take at
          least one opportunity to step back and ask yourself if this is
          making sense.
        </p>
        <h4>3. Crayons Beat Code</h4>
        <p>
          Make your mistakes at the cheap end of the project - draw your concepts,
          even as very rough scribbles, and see how you feel about them once
          you can see them. If it turns out they aren't useful or effective then
          at least you haven't spent hours trying to get them to work in code.
        </p>
