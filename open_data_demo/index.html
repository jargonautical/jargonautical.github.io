    <h3>Data Mince: collating datasets for demographic context</h3>
    <p>
      Why 'data mince'? Lucy explains:
    </p>
    <p class="info">
    "A long time ago, my brother went off to university and started learning to shop,
    cook and stay alive on a student's budget. He found out that pretty quickly
    he fell into a pattern; after a long day of lectures and coursework and
    assignments he would realise it was time to cook dinner. He'd chop an onion
    and start frying it, add some cheap beef mince to the pan ... and then realise
    he hadn't decided what he was actually going to cook. Chilli? Spag bol? Maybe go all
    out and make cottage pie? His basic fried-mince-and-onion was just the
    starting point.<br><br>
    What we found when we started working on projects for different clients, no
    matter how sophisticated the toolset or how complex the problem, was that we
    almost always needed to start with the same initial collection of demographic
    data; population, income, deprivation, working patterns and so on. This is
    what we call our 'data mince'."
  </p>
  <p>
    Working in the data science field in the middle of a global pandemic, there
    are many opportunties to start building tracking dashboards and viral
    infection models. But there are enough of those already, so we're focusing on
    how we can provide something useful to anyone trying to manage service demand or
    community responses to the current crisis.<br><br>
    We'll update this periodically as we find new and useful things to add to it,
    but for now here are the basics:<br>
    - population,<br>
    - deprivation<br>
    - economic activity.<br><br>
    All of the data we use here is published under the <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/">Open Government Licence</a> as open data.

  <h3>Looking at population variation</h3>

  <div id="pop-section" class="flex-container">

    <div class="box">
      <p>We always find it useful to look at the distribution of ages
        rather than the absolute values; the shape of a place's age
        profile tells you a lot when you compare it to the wider
        area. For example, Exeter and Plymouth stand out in this chart
        because of the much higher numbers of resident young people
        due to the universities. Torbay on the other hand has a profile skewed
        towards the older age ranges, as many people retire to the area.<br><br>

        If we were looking at something like vulnerability profiles, then both groups
        would be of interest. Outbreaks like the coronavirus are particularly concerning
        for the elderly and anyone with an underlying health condition, but young people
        are by no means immune. In fact a university environment can carry extra risks,
        e.g. dorms, house shares, group tutorials and lectures in spaces that see a
        lot of use.

  <h3>Economic vulnerability and differential impacts</h3>


  <div id="emp-section" class="flex-container">

    <div class="box">
      <p>
        Health isn't the only vulnerability factor; for many people self-employment,
        freelance and contracting work and zero-hours contracts have become a standard
        part of their income generation. To take a look at the potential numbers of
        people affected we can use the ONS Annual Labour Survey data - latest is for
        the year from October 2018 to September 2019.<br><br>

        These charts show two different attributes of the UK Business Counts data;
        the breakdown by legal status, which gives us the proportion of sole traders
        in a district, and the size band by number of employees so we can see where
        there's a high proprotion of businesses with, for example, fewer than 5 people
        working there.

      <h3>Indices of Multiple Deprivation (IMD)</h3>
      <p>
        Income and employment are far from the only measure of wellbeing - although they certainly make a
        difference. The Indices of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) are updated every few
        years and cover a wider range of measures including environment, barriers to
        opportunity, health and crime.<br><br>
        The top-level index of deprivation is calculated from a combination of the
        contributing indices, and assigns every small area (LSOA or Lower-level
        Super Output Area) in England a score based on how deprived the model says
        the area is in comparison to all the others. With all the LSOAs ranked in order,
        each one is then assigned to a decile with a numeric score from 1 to 10.
        Any LSOA with a decile score of 1 is therefore in the top 10% most deprived
        nationally; and the higher the decile score, the less deprived.<br><br>
        This chart looks at how many LSOAs per district fall into which deciles, so we can see
        that the more urban areas like Torbay and Plymouth have a far greater
        proportion of LSOAs with lower decile scores.<br>
